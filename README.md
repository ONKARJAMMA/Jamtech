
Jamtech A Hacker News Stories App 🌟

I'm excited to share my latest project – a React-based web application that leverages the Hacker News API to provide a dynamic, user-friendly experience for browsing and managing news stories.
💡 Key Features:
✅ Real-time data fetching from the Hacker News API
✅ Search functionality for finding stories on any topic
✅ Pagination for seamless navigation through stories
✅ Ability to remove irrelevant posts
✅ Built using React, Context API, and useReducer hook

🌐 Responsive Design ensures the app looks great on any device!
This project helped me deepen my skills in React, API integration, and state management.
